# Description of Coursework
This coursework involves using the yearly data set from the 1009 ASA Statistical Computing and Graphics Data Expo, consisting of flight and departure details for all commercial flights on major carriers within the USA.
The questions we have to answer are:

1. When is the best time of day, day of the week, and time of year to fly to minimise delays?
2. Do older planes suffer more delays?
3. How does the number of people flying between different locations change over time?
4. Can you detect ccascading failures as delays in one airport create delays in others?
5. Use the available varaibles to construct a model taht predicts delays.
